    "I'm a Digital Media professional based in Leeds, who takes profound interests in 3D modelling and Full-stack Web Development",
    "I spent two years in my hometown (Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam) learning IT, then decided to live a life on my own, to explore new culture, new inspiration and make an art out of my life. So I went to the UK in late 2018",
    "I love playing guitar (used to have a band with my mates before)",
    "I'm a gym addict, who goes to the gym and exercises like crazy every SINGLE DAY. One of the reasons for this is that, exercising really helps me, first and foremost, get fit. Then it creates room for me to release stress and allows me to come up with solutions to my problems. And lastly, it forces me to practise self-dicipline",
    "I'm a cheerful person so you don't have to worry about being awkward with me. I'll always try my best to cheer up people around me with the silliest jokes ever. Seems like I am destined for that. And I love the fact that I do have positive impact on people I care about"
